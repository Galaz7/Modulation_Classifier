## Introduction
This repository contains a classification modulator for 11 types of wavefroms.
The classifcation generated by convolutional neural network (CNN), a regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns feature engineering by 
itself via filters (or kernel) optimization.The entire training process is based on a code (in Matlab) of an artificial wave generator.

## Flow
### Generator
Generate by Matlab code a 10,000 frames for each modulation type that create the data set. Each frame is 1024 samples long and has a sample rate of 200 kHz. For digital modulation types, eight samples represent a symbol. The network makes each decision based on single frames rather than on multiple consecutive frames. 
Assume a center frequency of 902 MHz and 100 MHz for the digital and analog modulation types, respectively.
Create channel impairments by passing each frame through a channel with:
* [AWGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_white_Gaussian_noise#:~:text=Additive%20white%20Gaussian%20noise%20(AWGN,processes%20that%20occur%20in%20nature.))
* [Rician multipath fading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rician_fading#:~:text=Rician%20fading%20or%20Ricean%20fading,changing%20(lengthening%20or%20shortening).)
* [Clock offset](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/clocks.html#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20two%20clocks,network%20delay%20is%20called%20jitter.) (resulting in center frequency offset and sampling time drift)
* Because the network in this example makes decisions based on single frames, each frame must pass through an independent channel. 


The train set was trained by three different three well-known CNN architecturesarchitects with different SNR.
11 types of modulation - 8 digital and 3 analog wavefroms
* Binary phase shift keying (BPSK)
* Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)
* 8-ary phase shift keying (8-PSK)
* 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM)
* 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM)
* 4-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4)
* Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK)
* Continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK)
* Broadcast FM (B-FM)
* Double sideband amplitude modulation (DSB-AM)
* Single sideband amplitude modulation (SSB-AM)

** The classifier tested on reciver baseded software-defined radio (SDR) hardware.
